Mr. Van Hollen moved to recommit with instructions to the Committee on Ways and Means.,hr4719,HSWM,2014-01-17,,11:58:00,action
"DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Van Hollen motion to recommit with instructions pending a reseravation of a point of order. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the bill to be reported to the House with an amendment to extend the three existing charitable tax extenders and two new charitable tax provisions in the underlying bill for only two additional years, through the end of 2015, as opposed to the permanent extension costing $16 billion in the underlying bill. It would prevent these five tax cuts from permanently adding to the deficit, undermining comprehensive tax reform, and putting further pressure on the United States discretionary priorities. Additionally, the motion would deny any claiming of these five charitable tax provisions by inverted corporations that change their residence from the United States in order to avoid paying U.S. taxes. Subsequently, the point                of order was withdrawn.",hr4719,,2014-01-17,,11:58:00,action
