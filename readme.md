## Who are the most valuable politicians in Congress?

An on-going project to understand congressional effectiveness. How effective is congress at passing legislation? Are there any key players who are particularly good (or particularly bad)? How does this correlate with their popularity and/or notoriety?

This repository will hold the code to pull and analyze the data. Working drafts of visualizations will also probably live here. Any finished work will likely live on [my website](http://ben-tanen.com) (and in [the corresponding repo](https://github.com/ben-tanen/ben-tanen.github.io)).

**Stories to explore**:
1. How does a bill become a law (or die in congress)? A visualization of how a bill makes its way through committee, etc., and a story of how many of these bill die.
2. Are there any congress members who are particularly effective at authoring and/or co-signing legislation?
3. How does congressional effectiveness correlate with popularity and/or name recognition? Potentially look at Twitter followers, Google trends, etc.

**To Do:**
- [ ] Pull [bill data](https://www.govtrack.us/data/) and format into "tall" datasets
    - [ ] Build dataset(s) for each bill (bill name, bill id, type of bill, etc.)
    - [ ] Build dataset(s) for bill status and actions by bill (date, time, action, etc.)
    - [ ] Build dataset(s) for congressional members (name, party, tenure, popularity metrics, etc.)
    - [ ] Build dataset(s) for bill authors and cosigners
    - [ ] Repeat for senate
- [ ] Analyze data...
- [ ] Visualize data...
- [ ] Write stories...
