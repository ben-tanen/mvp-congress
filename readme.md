## Who are the most valuable politicians in Congress?

An on-going project to understand congressional effectiveness. How effective is congress at passing legislation? Are there any key players who are particularly good (or particularly bad)? How does this correlate with their popularity and/or notoriety?

This repository will hold the code to pull and analyze the data. Working drafts of visualizations will also probably live here. Any finished work will likely live on [my website](http://ben-tanen.com) (and in [the corresponding repo](https://github.com/ben-tanen/ben-tanen.github.io)).
